This is Snapchat's private API.

## Installation

You can install the library using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```sh
composer require picaboooo/snapchatsdk
```

```php
require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$snapchat = new \Snapchat\SnapchatClient();
```

### I don't have Composer

You can download it [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

## Usage

### Examples

Take a look at the [Examples folder](./examples).

### Login

To login, you will need to provide your Snapchat Username and Snapchat Password.  
If something goes wrong, an `Exception` will be thrown.

```php
try {
    $login = $snapchat->login("username", "password");
    // ...
} catch(Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage() . "\n";
}
```

Once you have logged in, the `$login` object will provide direct access to all of the fetched data. Such as Snaps, Conversations, Stories and Friends.

```php
$conversations = $login->getConversationsResponse(); // Snaps and Chat Messages
$friendsResponse = $login->getFriendsResponse(); // Friends, Friend Requests
$updatesResponse = $login->getUpdatesResponse(); // AuthToken, Score, Birthday, etc
$storiesResponse = $login->getStoriesResponse(); // Your Stories and Friends Stories
```

Similar methods exist directly on the `$snapchat` object, which will fetch fresh data from the server.

### AuthToken Login

If you save the Username and AuthToken, you can create a new instance of the `Snapchat` class at a later time with the `initWithAuthToken` method.

You can get the Username and AuthToken from a logged in `Snapchat` instance with `getUsername` and `getAuthToken`, for saving somewhere...

```php
// Save these somewhere. Database etc.
$username = $snapchat->getUsername();
$authToken = $snapchat->getAuthToken();
```

```php
// New Instance somewhere else. example, another PHP file.
$snapchat->initWithAuthToken("username", "auth_token");
```

When using the AuthToken method, you don't have access to the `$login` object.

You will need to use the methods with similar names on the `$snapchat` object instead.

```php
$conversations = $snapchat->getConversations(); // Snaps and Chat Messages
$friendsResponse = $snapchat->getCachedFriendsResponse(); // Friends, Friend Requests
$updatesResponse = $snapchat->getAllUpdates(); // AuthToken, Score, Birthday, etc
$storiesResponse = $snapchat->getStories(); // Your Stories and Friends Stories
```

### Friends

Friend data is provided in the response of multiple API calls, but not it's own endpoint. You can access the currently cached Friend data like so:

```php
$snapchat->getCachedFriendsResponse();
```

If you need to fetch updated Friend data from the server, you will need to call the `getAllUpdates` method.

```php
$friendsResponse = $snapchat->getAllUpdates()->getFriendsResponse(); // Friends, Friend Requests
```

In the case above, the `getCachedFriendsResponse()` will now return the updated data.

### Conversations

Snaps and Chat Messages are both located within `ConversationMessages`. Here's a few examples on how to iterate over them.

#### Get all unviewed received Snaps

```php
foreach($conversations as $conversation) {
    $snaps = $conversation->getConversationMessages()->getSnaps();
    foreach($snaps as $snap) {
        if ($snap->wasReceived() && !$snap->hasBeenViewed()) {
            // Do something with the unread Snap...
        }
    }
}
```

### Download Snaps

Unviewed Snaps can be downloaded with via the `downloadSnap` method.

You need to pass in the `Snap` object (or the Snap ID as a string) you want to download, along with a File Path, in which the Snap will be saved to.

You can optionally provide a File Path for the Video Overlay. (If one isn't provided, it will be generated for you).

File extensions are not automatically appended to the file name for you. If you have access to the `Snap` object, you can call `$snap->getFileExtension();` which will provide you with `jpg` or `mp4`, depending on the Snap type.

If everything goes successfully, the `downloadSnap` method will return a `MediaPath` object, which contains the File Paths of the Saved media. (Blob and Overlay). Otherwise an `Exception` will be thrown on Failure...

```php
$snap = ...;

$filename = sprintf("my_snap_folder/%s.%s", $snap->getId(), $snap->getFileExtension());
$mediapath = $snapchat->downloadSnap($snap, $filename);

$file_blob = $mediapath->getBlobPath();
$file_overlay = $mediapath->getOverlayPath();

echo "Blob saved to: " . $file_blob. "\n";

if ($mediapath->overlayExists()) {
  echo "Overlay saved to: " . $file_overlay. "\n";
}
```

#### Download all unviewed received Snaps

```php
$conversations = $login->getConversationsResponse();
foreach ($conversations as $conversation) {
    $snaps = $conversation->getConversationMessages()->getSnaps();
    foreach ($snaps as $snap) {
        if ($snap->wasReceived() && !$snap->hasBeenViewed()) {
            echo "Downloading Snap from: " . $snap->getSender() . "\n";

            $filename = sprintf("snaps/%s.%s", $snap->getId(), $snap->getFileExtension());
            $mediapath = $snapchat->downloadSnap($snap, $filename);

            echo "Blob saved to: " . $mediapath->getBlobPath(). "\n";

            if ($mediapath->overlayExists()) {
                echo "Overlay saved to: " . $mediapath->getOverlayPath(). "\n";
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Stories

#### Download My Stories

```php
// Get Stories from Login Response
$storiesResponse = $login->getStoriesResponse();

foreach ($storiesResponse->getMyStories() as $myStories) {
    $story = $myStories->getStory(); // The Story object
    $storyNotes = $myStories->getStoryNotes(); // Details about who viewed your Story
    $storyExtras = $myStories->getStoryExtras(); // View and Screenshot counts

    // Where to Save the Story
    $filename = sprintf("download/stories/%s.%s", $story->getId(), $story->getFileExtension());

    // Download the Story
    $mediapath = $snapchat->downloadStory($story, $filename);
}
```

### Download Friend Stories

All of the Stories posted by a User are inside of a container.

The `getFriendStories()` method on the `StoriesResponse` instance will return an array of `FriendStory` objects.

`FriendStory` objects contain the Friends username along with an array of `FriendStoryContainer` objects.

Calling `getStories()` method on the `FriendStory` object will return the `FriendStoryContainer`.

A `FriendStoryContainer` gives you access to the `Story` object posted by the user along with a boolean stating if you have seen the Story.

```php
// Get Stories from Login Response
$storiesResponse = $login->getStoriesResponse();

// Iterate Friend Stories
foreach ($storiesResponse->getFriendStories() as $friendStories) {
    $friendStoriesUsername = $friendStories->getUsername();
    $storiesContainer = $friendStories->getStories();
    
    foreach ($storiesContainer as $storyContainer) {
        $story = $storyContainer->getStory();

        echo "Downloading Story: " . $story->getId() . "\n";

        // Where to Save the Files
        $filename = sprintf("download/stories/%s", $story->getId());
        $filename_overlay = sprintf("download/stories/%s_overlay", $story->getId());

        // Download the Story
        $mediapath = $snapchat->downloadStory($story, $filename, $filename_overlay);

        echo "Story saved to: " . $mediapath->getBlobPath(). "\n";

        if ($mediapath->overlayExists()) {
            echo "Story Overlay saved to: " . $mediapath->getOverlayPath(). "\n";
        }
    }
}
```

### Logout

To logout of Snapchat, call the `logout` method on the `Snapchat` instance.

```php
$snapchat->logout();
```

## Documentation

At the moment, there's no proper documentation. However, the above gives you an overview of what the library can do.

[Take a look at the examples](./examples) folder, as well as the methods available in the `SnapchatClient` class to see what else can be done.
